Hi! I'm currently building a personal website. The plan is to first build a static HTML/CSS website with some JS functions and then consider converting it to a React App (if I have time).

I'm planning on integrating some kind of API as well. Maybe what I'm currently listening to on Spotify (although that's kind of intrusive)? Maybe a ChatGPT chatbox?

To run the contact box functionality:
    1. Open a terminal and in the root run 'python3 -m http.server 3000'
    2. Open a separate terminal and enter the contact-backend folder. Run 'index.js'
    3. When running the app, ensure you are at http://localhost:3000
