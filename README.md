Hi! I'm currently building a personal website. The plan is to first build a static HTML/CSS website with some JS functions and then consider converting it to a React App (if I have time).

I'm planning on integrating some kind of API as well. Maybe what I'm currently listening to on Spotify (although that's kind of intrusive)? Maybe a ChatGPT chatbox?
