Hi! I'm currently building a personal website. It is now fully deployed at https://emilylu.vercel.app. This was written with HTML/CSS and JS functions, incorporating Express.js to handle POST requests for the contact form. The backend is deployed on Render's Free Plan, so it may experience some difficulties when data runs out.
